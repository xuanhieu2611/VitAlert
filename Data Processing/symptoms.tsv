Nutrient	Function	Symptoms
Vitamin A	Involved in immune function, vision, cell growth and cell communication.	Night blindness and xerophthalmia (16).
Vitamin B6	Involved in greater than 100 enzyme reactions in the body and involved in protein metabolism.	Microcytic anemia, scaling of the lips and cracks in the corners of the mouth, swollen tongue, depression, and confusion (17).
Vitamin B12	Involved in red blood cell formation, neurological function, and DNA synthesis.	Megaloblastic anemia, fatigue, weakness, constipation, loss of appetite, and weight loss (13).
Vitamin C	Involved in the formation of collagen, certain neurotransmitters, and protein synthesis.	Development of scurvy which would include: fatigue, inflammation of the gums, and weakened connective tissue (14).
Vitamin D	Promotes calcium absorption and proper bone formation, involved in cell growth, immune function, and reduces inflammation.	Development of rickets in children or osteomalacia in adults, and fatigue (18).
Calcium	Involved in muscle function, nerve transmission, and proper bone formation.	Development of osteoporosis (19).
Folate	Involved in the synthesis of RNA and DNA and is required for cell division and the prevention of Neural Tube Defects.	Megaloblastic anemia (20).
Iodine	A component of thyroid hormones that regulate protein synthesis, metabolism, and enzyme activity.	Stunted growth and neurodevelopmental deficits (7).
Iron	A component of hemoglobin and therefore important in the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to organs, and involved in the synthesis of hormones as well as normal growth and development.	Microcytic, hypochromic anemia; impaired cognitive function, poor body temperature regulation, depressed immune function, and spoon like shape of nails (9).
Magnesium	Involved in more than 300 enzyme reactions, protein synthesis, muscle function, nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure control.	Loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, and abnormal heart rhythms (15).
Zinc	Involved in cell metabolism, enzyme activity, immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division.	Stunted growth, depressed immune function, hair loss, eye and skin lesions, delayed wound healing, and taste alterations (21).
