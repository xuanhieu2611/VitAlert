## About Our Project

**94% Of Canadians are deficient in one or more nutrients.** [(1)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8408873/)

"VitAlert" is a web application designed to help individuals maintain a balanced diet by tracking their daily food intake. Developed during the 24-hour NWHacks 2024 hackathon.
Our inspiration stems from the growing prevalence of nutrient deficiencies, impacting overall health and well-being. 
In a world where busy schedules often lead to suboptimal dietary choices, "Vitalert" is a solution that empowers users to make informed decisions about their nutrition.
Our mission is to bridge the gap between dietary habits and optimal health by providing actionable insights tailored to individual needs.
Unlike generic nutrition apps, "Vitalert" goes beyond tracking; it actively identifies nutrient deficiencies and suggests personalized dietary adjustments.
We believe in not just monitoring but guiding users toward a healthier lifestyle.
